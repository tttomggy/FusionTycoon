# Combat: weapons, hits, ragdoll

Moved out of CLAUDE.md (verbatim). Read this file when a task touches this system.

- **Combat** (`CombatService`, every number in `CombatConfig`;
  `CombatController` client). Cartoon bonks: **no health, damage or
  deaths**. Weapons are **earned, never sold** (the "never" list): Bat
  (Rebirth 1, melee 7 studs, 1.2 s, knockback 60), Laser Gun (Rebirth 2,
  hitscan 60, 3 s, 35), Freeze Ray (Rebirth 3, 40 studs, 6 s, 40% speed for
  3 s, no ragdoll), Slap Glove (quest: melee 6, 2.5 s, 120) and Banana Peel
  (quest: one out, 10 s, lasts 20 s, the first enemy to step on it slips).
  `PlayerData.Weapons` (a set, sanitised, snapshot `Weapons`); an OnSync
  hook grants rebirth weapons + `WeaponUnlocked` (the tutorial-style card);
  Roblox `Tool`s in the Backpack, given on every spawn; the default Backpack
  bar is replaced by glyph circles above the bottom buttons (1–5 / tap,
  cooldown wipe, unearned rebirth weapons greyed "R1"–"R3", greyed while
  carrying). **Rules:** only Rebirth 1+ vs Rebirth 1+; no hits for 5 s after
  spawning; a hit ragdolls 1.5 s with knockback (+ an upward kick), then 3 s
  immune (a shimmer). **Server authority:** `RequestHit { Weapon,
  TargetUserId?, Origin, Direction }` (C→S) is re-checked: owned AND
  equipped, the server cooldown (`TakeCooldown`), both sides' eligibility
  (`WhyNotHittable`), the attacker not carrying / ragdolled, melee range
  from the server roots + `RangeSlack` and in front, ranged by a server
  raycast; `RemoteGuard` numbers and rate limit. The server owns Player
  attributes `RagdollUntil` / `ImmuneUntil` / `FrozenUntil` /
  `SpawnProtectUntil` (server time), swaps Motor6Ds for
  BallSocketConstraints (replicated) and restores them; `HitReceived
  { Impulse, Seconds, Freeze? }` (S→target: Physics state + impulse, prompts
  off) and `HitFx` (S→all: BONK! / SLIP! / FROZEN! pops, a thin Neon
  cylinder beam). **Heist:** a hit on a carrying thief →
  `HeistService.KnockCarrier` (outcome `Knocked`: the orb flies home, the
  owner sees SAVED); a ragdolled player can't steal, LOCK (`Ragdolled`) or
  guard, so a bonk can open a steal. Analytics `Hit` (weapon),
  `ThiefKnocked`, `GuardKnocked`. The Rebirth panel lists each rebirth's
  weapons (`RebirthConfig.GetUnlockText`). Studio `/weapons all | reset`.
  Sound slots Bonk / Laser / Freeze / Slip are empty until picked.
