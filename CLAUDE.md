# FusionTycoon

Roblox tycoon game. Rojo project — source of truth is the filesystem under
`src/`, synced into Studio. Toolchain is managed by Aftman (`aftman.toml`).

## Commands

```sh
rojo serve default.project.json     # live-sync into Studio
rojo build -o build.rbxl default.project.json

# Type checking (requires `aftman install` first — needs an interactive
# trust prompt the first time luau-lsp is fetched):
rojo sourcemap default.project.json -o sourcemap.json
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp/main/scripts/globalTypes.d.luau -o globalTypes.d.luau
luau-lsp analyze --sourcemap=sourcemap.json --defs=globalTypes.d.luau src/
```

**`rojo build` does not validate Luau.** Verified: it exits 0 on outright
broken syntax and embeds it verbatim. It checks project/file structure only.
A green `rojo build` is *not* evidence that code compiles — use `luau-lsp
analyze` for that.

## Game loop & economy (read before balancing)

Claim plot → Dropper1 (+Dropper2) → buy Generators in the UPGRADES panel →
Gacha Pad pulls → fuse 2 same-tier items at your plot's Fusion Machine
(success = next tier, fail = 1 item of the same tier back) → display the best
4 items on pedestals for passive income → Multiplier Pad multiplies ALL income.

- All economy numbers live in `TycoonConfig.lua` (costs, pedestal income,
  multiplier levels, gacha price curve) and `FusionConfig.lua` (fusion success
  odds, gacha drop rates). They were tuned with a greedy-player simulation
  of a brand-new save; the target milestones are in TycoonConfig's header.
  Re-simulate after changing them instead of eyeballing.
- Passive income has ONE formula: `TycoonConfig.GetPassiveCashPerSecond`,
  used by the server payout tick and the client HUD.
- Every service syncs the client with `PlayerDataService.SyncTycoon(player)`.
  Do not hand-build SyncTycoon payloads.
- Each plot builds its own Fusion Machine (`FusionMachineService.Build`,
  called from `TycoonService.createPlotForPlayer`).
- Saves: a failed DataStore load kicks the player in live games (never
  overwrites the real save); in Studio it plays on a blank profile that is
  never saved. PedestalDisplays are stored with string keys on disk.
- Studio chat commands (DebugService): `/cash <amount>`, `/resetmultiplier`,
  `/wipe`.

## Layout

```
src/ReplicatedStorage/Shared/
    Config/      shared config tables (PlotLayout, TycoonConfig, FusionConfig,
                 GoalConfig — the ordered onboarding goals, …)
    Modules/     shared runtime modules (PartKit, StationKit, PedestalVisuals,
                 NumberFormat, UITheme — every UI colour/font token,
                 BillboardKit — server-built world labels)
    Network/     RemoteEvents.lua — single source of truth for remotes
    VFX/         SparkleEmitter, ImportedEffects, imported *.rbxm VFX assets
src/ServerScriptService/
    Bootstrap.server.lua   entry point; hands Services/ to ServiceManager
    ServiceManager.lua     loading + Init/Start lifecycle
    Services/              one ModuleScript per service (GoalService pays
                           and advances goals from PlayerDataService.OnSync)
src/StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts/
    Controllers/  client controllers (one per domain): HudController,
                  ToastController (error/neutral toasts), ResultController
                  (fusion/gacha result cards), AnnouncementController
                  (banners), WorldLabelController (hides owner-only labels)…
    Effects/      RevealEffects
    UI/           UIKit (Panel/Button/Pill/Badge/TierOrb/ProgressBar/
                  Shadow/PopIn/PopOut/Modal), UpgradesPanel, ItemPickerUI
```

### UI rules ("Fusion Lab" design — spec in `docs/UI_REDESIGN_PROMPT.md`)

- **All UI colours come from `UITheme`.** No `Color3.fromRGB`/`fromHex` in
  any UI file other than `UITheme.lua`; add a token instead. Fonts too
  (`UITheme.Fonts`). This covers server-built BillboardGuis (`BillboardKit`).
- Build screens from `UIKit` constructors. Panel/Button return
  `(body, holder)`: position/parent the holder (it also hosts the sibling
  `Shadow`), style the body. Restyle buttons with `UIKit.SetButton`.
- Every ScreenGui comes from `UIKit.Screen`, which adds the single mobile
  `UIScale` (0.8 under 500 px tall). Phone layouts react to
  `UIKit.LayoutChanged`. Keep the top-left 170×60 px clear (Roblox top bar)
  **after** that scale, and every tap target ≥ 44 px.
- Money/multipliers always go through `NumberFormat.Money`/`.Multiplier`.
- World labels: `AlwaysOnTop = false`, `LightInfluence = 0`, a MaxDistance.
  Owner-only labels set the `OwnerOnly` attribute; don't toggle them per
  player on the server.
- Studio checklist for UI changes: `docs/UI_TEST.md`.

## Architecture

### Service Lifecycle Rules

- All services in `src/ServerScriptService/Services/` must follow
  `ServiceTemplate.lua`.
- `ServiceManager.lua` executes `:Init()` sequentially across services, then
  `:Start()`.
- Cross-service requires must occur inside `:Start()`, **never** at top-level
  module load.
- Maintain static dot-notation for public APIs (`Service.Method(p)`) and keep
  colon-notation strictly for lifecycle calls (`:Init()`, `:Start()`).

Supporting detail:

- `:Init()` is self-contained setup only — own state, own remote handlers, own
  connections. It must not touch another service, and must not depend on Init
  order.
- `:Start()` is where cross-service references are resolved. By then every
  service has finished Init.
- The idiom for a cross-service reference keeps the identifier name so call
  sites read unchanged:
  ```lua
  type PlayerDataServiceModule = typeof(require(script.Parent.PlayerDataService))
  local PlayerDataService: PlayerDataServiceModule   -- declared, not assigned

  function MyService:Start()
      PlayerDataService = require(script.Parent.PlayerDataService)
  end
  ```
  `typeof(require(…))` is a type-level reference only — it does not require the
  module at runtime, so it cannot create a load-time cycle.
- **Never yield in `:Init()`.** Init and Start run back-to-back with no yield
  between them, which is what makes the "declared but not yet assigned" window
  unreachable. A yielding Init breaks that guarantee.
- Modules named `*Template` are skipped by `ServiceManager` and never loaded.
- `ServiceManager.INIT_ORDER` is an explicit, temporary boot order preserved
  from the pre-refactor Bootstrap. It is load-bearing only until every service
  honours the Init/Start contract; do not add ordering dependencies to it.

**Migration status — lifecycle migration is complete.** All seven services use
colon lifecycle methods, private state tables, and resolve every cross-service
reference inside `:Start()`. There are zero top-level `require(script.Parent.*)`
calls left in `Services/`.

| Service | Lifecycle | Cross-service refs | Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PlayerDataService` | `:Init()` | — (leaf) | `--!strict` |
| `FusionService` | `:Init()` `:Start()` | `PlayerDataService` | `--!strict` |
| `ItemService` | `:Init()` `:Start()` | `PlayerDataService`, `TycoonService` | `--!strict` |
| `LightingService` | `:Init()` | — | `--!strict` |
| `DebugService` | `:Init()` `:Start()` | `PlayerDataService` | `--!strict` |
| `GoalService` | `:Init()` `:Start()` | `PlayerDataService`, `TycoonService` | `--!strict` |
| `TycoonService` | `:Init()` `:Start()` | `PlayerDataService` (module scope, leaf), `FusionMachineService` (Start) | `--!nonstrict` ⚠ |
| `FusionMachineService` | `:Init()` | — | `--!nonstrict` ⚠ |

⚠ **Strict-mode conversion is the one thing still outstanding.** Both flagged
files are dense Instance construction, and there is still no Luau type checker
installed, so flipping them blind would ship an unknown number of type errors
nobody can see locally. Install the checker (see `aftman.toml`) and convert
each as its own reviewable pass. Everything else about them already follows the
pattern.

`ServiceManager` calls `service:Init()`, which also works for a legacy
`function Service.Init()` definition (it ignores the extra `self`) — that
compatibility is what allowed the migration to happen service-by-service, and
it is retained so future additions can do the same.

### Known type-checker findings (unfixed, tracked)

`luau-lsp analyze` currently reports **2 pre-existing errors in one shared
module**. They predate the service-lifecycle work, are unrelated to it, and
were deliberately left alone rather than fixed opportunistically. The file is
unannotated (default nonstrict). Do not "clean these up" as a drive-by — they
deserve their own reviewed change. (`PadStyler.lua`, which owned 13 more, was
deleted in the world redesign.)

**`Shared/VFX/SparkleEmitter.lua` — 2 errors**

- Lines 17, 35: `Value of type 'SparkleEmitterOptions?' could be nil`. The
  `options = options or {}` idiom does not narrow the optional parameter for
  the checker; the fix is a narrowed local (`local style = options or {}`).

Note these are reported whenever you analyze any module that transitively
requires it (most of `Services/`), so a "clean" run means *no errors owned by
the file under test* — check the path on each reported line.

### Remotes

`ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Network.RemoteEvents` is the only place remotes are
created; it builds the container folder (named `RemoteEvents`) on the server
and makes the client `WaitForChild` it. Never call `Instance.new("RemoteEvent")`
in a service. To add one: add the name to `REMOTE_EVENT_NAMES` with a comment
stating direction, then connect it in `:Init()`.

### Sync hooks

`PlayerDataService.OnSync(callback)` registers a function that runs
synchronously at the start of every `SyncTycoon`, before the snapshot is
built, so whatever it changes ships in that snapshot (GoalService uses it to
pay goals and publish `GoalProgress`). Hooks must not call `SyncTycoon`
themselves. It is a plain callback list on purpose: a BindableEvent handler
would run deferred, after the snapshot was already sent.

### Server authority

Services never trust client-supplied ownership, tiers, or instance references.
Resolve everything server-side from the requesting `Player` and validate before
mutating (see `ItemService.onRequestPlaceItem`, `FusionService.onFusionRequest`).

### Shared layout math

`Shared/Config/PlotLayout.lua` is the single source of truth for plot geometry
(row offsets, pedestal showcase position, Floor extents). `TycoonService` and
`FusionMachineService` both read from it. Never hardcode a second copy of a
position in a service — that class of duplicated assumption caused most of this
project's layout bugs.

## Gotchas

- **Plots are cloned once per player per server session.** Layout/pad changes
  do not appear in an already-running session — stop and restart Play. Same for
  the Fusion Machine, which is built once at server startup.
- **Binary assets are `.rbxm` under a blanket `.gitignore` exclusion** with
  explicit carve-outs (`!TycoonTemplate.rbxm`,
  `!src/ReplicatedStorage/Shared/VFX/*.rbxm`). A new `.rbxm` added elsewhere
  will be silently untracked.
- `.rbxm` files inside a `$path`-mapped folder are auto-synced by Rojo and named
  after the filename (descendants keep their authored names). Only assets
  outside such a folder — e.g. root-level `TycoonTemplate.rbxm` — need their own
  `default.project.json` entry.
- `Enum.Material.Metal` renders dark regardless of `Color3` under this game's
  lighting. Use `Enum.Material.Neon` for accent colors that must read as bright.
- A line starting with `(` directly after a statement ending in an expression is
  parsed as a call spanning both lines. Route casts through a local
  (`local x = y :: T`) instead of inline `(y :: T).Field = …`.
